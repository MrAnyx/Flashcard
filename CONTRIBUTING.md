## Overview

The Meeio API is a Symfony REST API designed to facilitate the creation, organization, and review of flashcards. Built with a developer-friendly approach, this API serves as the backend for a Nuxt.js application, providing users with the tools to efficiently manage their learning resources.

## Features

- **Create and Organize Flashcards**: Users can create flashcards categorized by topics and units.
- **Review Sessions**: Facilitates organized review sessions for effective learning.
- **RESTful API**: Built using Symfony 6, adhering to best practices in API development.
- **Docker Support**: Easy setup and development using Docker and Devcontainer.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Meeio API, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meeio-app/backend.git
   cd backend
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once cloned, the recommended way to work is by using the **devcontainer** prebuilt file. Is contains everything you want to work properly. For that, we recommend using the **Visual Studio Code** editor.
Otherwise, you can still do the manual way.

2. **Build the Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   cd .devcontainer
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Prepare the project**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec task a:d:c
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost`.
