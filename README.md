This project is the [Symfony backend REST API](https://github.com/MrAnyx/Flashcard-API) for a [flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) platform.

I started this project because I couldn’t find a flashcard app that combined both a modern, visually appealing interface and effective functionality.

My goal was to create a good-looking flashcard app that provides a streamlined user experience.

Additionally, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the algorithms that drive flashcard-based learning, particularly those focused on optimizing review timing and content retention.

While I have always worked with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) for both frontend and backend, I wanted to expand into using a dedicated frontend framework like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) to take advantage of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), which I really enjoy working with.

This project merges these goals by offering an intuitive platform that makes studying both efficient and enjoyable.

## Built With

This project is entirely built using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and its ecosystem like [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/). It also uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) when developing.
