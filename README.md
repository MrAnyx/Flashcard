![Product example gif](assets/product-example.gif)

This project is the [Symfony backend REST API](https://github.com/MrAnyx/Flashcard-API) for a [flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) platform.

I started this project because I couldn’t find a flashcard app that combined both a modern, visually appealing interface and effective functionality.

My goal was to create a good-looking flashcard app that provides a streamlined user experience.

Additionally, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the algorithms that drive flashcard-based learning, particularly those focused on optimizing review timing and content retention.

While I have always worked with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) for both frontend and backend, I wanted to expand into using a dedicated frontend framework like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) to take advantage of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), which I really enjoy working with.

This project merges these goals by offering an intuitive platform that makes studying both efficient and enjoyable.

### Built With

This project is entirely built using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and its ecosystem like [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/). It also uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) when developing.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = "ENTER YOUR API";
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
